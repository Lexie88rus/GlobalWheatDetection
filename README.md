1. [Deep learning based banana plant detection and counting using high-resolution red-green-blue (RGB) images collected from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223906). The objective of this research is focused to automate the count of banana plants during early stage of growth, in which they are prone to lose maturity.
2. [Fine-grained recognition of plants from images](https://plantmethods.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13007-017-0265-4). Fine-grained recognition of plants from images is a challenging computer vision task, due to the diverse appearance and complex structure of plants, high intra-class variability and small inter-class differences. We review the state-of-the-art and discuss plant recognition tasks, from identification of plants from specific plant organs to general plant recognition “in the wild”.
